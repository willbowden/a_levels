# Trees
- A **tree** is a **connected, undirected graph with no cycles**. 
- Connected means there is always a possible path from one node to another.
- No Cycles means it is not possible to traverse from any node back to the start node without having to traverse the same edge twice.

### Structures Of A Tree
| Structure | Purpose                |
| --------- | ---------------------- |
| Node      | Contains the tree data |
| Edge      | Links two nodes        |
|           |                        |
